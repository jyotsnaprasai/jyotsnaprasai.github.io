I am an independent researcher in economics, and currently looking for MS or PhD opportunities in the U.S. 

My research interests are in development and natural resource economics. 

My CV is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zo7f5rpg3ibchds6qlcbz/CV_JPrasai.pdf?rlkey=07rl0qv2fzw8ikydfj9nk3agi&st=58gdtqin&dl=0).

I completed my undergraduate in business administration from Tribhuwan University, Nepal in 2019.


I originally come from a [small town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birtamod_Municipality) in south-eastern Nepal.
