I am a third year PhD student at [Arizona State University](https://wpcarey.asu.edu). I work with Timothy Richards.

My research interests are in empirical industrial organization and labor economics. 

#### Recent activities: 

* Presented at AAEA Annual Meeting, Washington DC, July 2023

* Presented at INFORMS Marketing Science Conference, Miami FL, June 2023. I was also an invited Doctoral Fellow at the Doctoral Consortium in the conference. 

Prior to joining ASU, I studied mathematics at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://math.ethz.ch) and [Jacobs University Bremen](http://math.jacobs-university.de), where I completed my MS and BS, respectively. 

I originally come from a [village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budhabare,_Jhapa) in south-eastern Nepal.
