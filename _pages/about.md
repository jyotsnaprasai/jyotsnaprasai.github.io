I am an independent researcher in economics, and currently looking for MS or PhD opportunities in United States.

My research interests are in development and natural resource economics.

I completed my undergraduate in business administration from Tribhuwan University, Nepal in 2019.


I originally come from a [small town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birtamod_Municipality) in south-eastern Nepal.
