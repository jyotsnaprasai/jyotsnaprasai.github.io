I am a third year PhD student at [Arizona State University](https://wpcarey.asu.edu).

My primary research interests are in empirical industrial organization and labor economics, with a focus on US food and retail industries. I work with Timothy Richards.

Prior to joining ASU, I studied mathematics at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://math.ethz.ch) and [Jacobs University Bremen](http://math.jacobs-university.de), where I completed my MS and BS, respectively. 

I originally come from a [village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budhabare,_Jhapa) in south-eastern Nepal.
