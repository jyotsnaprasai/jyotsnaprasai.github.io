I am an independent researcher in economics, and currently looking for MS or PhD opportunities in the U.S. 

My research interests are in development and natural resource economics. 

My CV is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uf71exm5px08gjbxueebk/CV_JPrasai.pdf?rlkey=o17ixygvnttu3uyutiapq1d9z&st=hfoa8pdm&dl=0).

I completed my undergraduate in business administration from Tribhuwan University, Nepal in 2019.


I originally come from a [small town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birtamod_Municipality) in south-eastern Nepal.
