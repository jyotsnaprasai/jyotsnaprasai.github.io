During my internship at Birat Multipurpose Co-operative Limited (BMCL), I worked in both the Customer Service Department (CSD) and the Loan Department. My responsibilities in the CSD included dealing with customer inquiries, opening and closing accounts, issuing cheque books, and updating KYC forms. In the Loan Department, I was involved in scanning documents, accepting loan installments, and writing security documents under supervision. This experience allowed me to develop significant communication and interpersonal skills, as well as practical knowledge in financial services and customer relations.

**Semester Project on Prospects and Challenges of Internet Banking in Jhapa, Nepal**. 2018-2019.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('internet')">Further Information</a> | [Full Report](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s8dxiyb0ifyf32u198rrv/Internet-Banking.docx?rlkey=p9f058yjkaiz89e9qc0shwq8o&dl=0)] </small>

<div id="internet" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

During my internship project, as a part of the BBA curriculum, I focused on understanding the current state and future potential of internet banking services in Birtamode, Nepal. I conducted a survey with 60 banking customers in Birtamode-4 to gather data on their awareness, usage, and perceptions of internet banking. The analysis revealed that while a significant majority of respondents were aware of internet banking, many still did not use it due to reasons such as lack of familiarity, security concerns, and inadequate access to the internet. My findings suggest that increasing financial literacy, improving security measures, and enhancing the user-friendliness of internet banking platforms could significantly boost the adoption of internet banking services in the region.
