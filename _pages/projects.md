**Intern at Ministry of Health and Population, Government of Nepal**. 2020.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('nutrition')">Further Information</a> | [Full Report](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uz792z97o1xtx1pjq8i9v/Report-on-costing-of-NNS-final.pdf?rlkey=3ec3z2m7xd1qqp7x2mmzl3zfi&st=24uyh7k5&dl=0)] </small>

During the project on costing the National Nutrition Strategy (NNS) in Nepal, I contributed to designing a sustainable costing model for nutrition-specific interventions. This model was developed to support the National Nutrition Action Plan for 2020/2021 to 2024/2025, ensuring adequate funding at the federal, provincial, and local government levels. The project involved defining activities based on the NNS, identifying necessary inputs, determining quantities, and adapting central procurement prices to calculate the total cost. The final report provided a detailed financial framework to keep the country on track with achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals on nutrition.

During the project on the cost analysis of tobacco-related cancer in Nepal, I contributed to determining the direct medical costs, nonmedical costs, and productivity losses due to illness. The study aimed to assess the economic burden of tobacco-related cancers on patients and their families. My role involved collecting and analyzing data from 103 patients across three hospitals, focusing on the costs incurred during diagnosis and treatment, including inpatient and outpatient services, travel, food, and accommodation expenses. The findings highlighted the significant financial impact on households, emphasizing the need for increased government subsidies and higher taxes on tobacco products to alleviate the economic strain on affected families.

During my internship at Birat Multipurpose Co-operative Limited (BMCL), I worked in both the Customer Service Department (CSD) and the Loan Department. My responsibilities in the CSD included dealing with customer inquiries, opening and closing accounts, issuing cheque books, and updating KYC forms. In the Loan Department, I was involved in scanning documents, accepting loan installments, and writing security documents under supervision. This experience allowed me to develop significant communication and interpersonal skills, as well as practical knowledge in financial services and customer relations.

**Semester Project on Prospects and Challenges of Internet Banking in Jhapa, Nepal**. 2018-2019.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('internet')">Further Information</a> | [Full Report](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kv5jgr0puqb8ohq4wcse4/Internet.docx?rlkey=nx0rkyhm46k9o5enxtetrr3fw&st=oqyeenyq&dl=0)] </small>

<div id="internet" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

During my semester project, as a part of the BBA curriculum, I focused on understanding the current state and future potential of internet banking services in Birtamode, Nepal. I conducted a survey with 60 banking customers in Birtamode-4 to gather data on their awareness, usage, and perceptions of internet banking. The analysis revealed that while a significant majority of respondents were aware of internet banking, many still did not use it due to reasons such as lack of familiarity, security concerns, and inadequate access to the internet. My findings suggest that increasing financial literacy, improving security measures, and enhancing the user-friendliness of internet banking platforms could significantly boost the adoption of internet banking services in the region.
