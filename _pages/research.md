**Cross-Platform Merger Effects**. 2023. <br/>

 Mergers and acquisitions tend to affect the prices and varieties offered by the merging firms. However, most of the existing research considers mergers between firms that interact on the same platform, such as between two online firms, or two firms on the same physical platform. To our knowledge, there is no empirical research on the price effects of integration across different platforms. Such cross-platform mergers likely have substantially different impacts on prices because indirect network effects are much weaker for physical firms than those that interact in low-cost environments having long-tail effects due to lower search costs and fewer constraints on physical inventory. We investigate this problem by analyzing the effects of an acquisition of a national grocery chain by a large online retailer in the United States. Our study differs from prior studies on mergers and acquisitions as the incentives to merge involve not
only the usual market power and efficiency arguments, but accessing stronger, indirect network externalities as well. Because the decision to merge is endogenous, identifying merger effects is empirically difficult. We use a doubly-robust causal inference method
to address this problem, and we find an evidence of a decrease in price levels in 8 out of 10 treated markets.

**Retail Concentration and Wages** (with Tim Richards and Kenan Marchesi). 2024. Submitted.<br/>

 Antitrust policy in the U.S. now explicitly includes labor-market outcomes as measures of interest when considering the potential anticompetitive effects of mergers or acquisitions. Concentration in the food retailing industry is of particular concern due to several recent high-profile mergers, and a troubling increase in concentration at the national and local levels. We study this problem using both causal reduced-form models and a structural model of search, match, and bargaining. Our reduced-form models show no relationship between concentration and wages, but our structural model finds that concentration is associated with substantial wage suppression.

**Cost Shocks and Price Pass-through** (with Tim Richards). 2024.<br/>

 Price inflation rose dramatically in late 2021. While there were many potential causes, some point to rising minimum wages, and wage inflation, as perhaps the most important source of food-price inflation. There is a large body of research that studies the aggregate effects of minimum wages, but none consider the precise mechanisms that link higher food prices and minimum wages in an environment of high general price inflation. In this study, we investigate the possibility that general price inflation serves as a facilitating mechanism for localized price inflation. We estimate both reduced-form and structural models of minimum-wage pass-through. Reduced-form models show that general price inflation has a positive effect on minimum wage pass-through to retail food prices. However, reduced-form models cannot account for the effects of demand curvature and imperfect competition. Our structural model shows that, after controlling for the primary determinants of wage pass-through, general price inflation has an important role in accentuating the rate of minimum-wage pass-through. Our findings have important implications for minimum wage policy, and for understanding the role of labor cost in retail price inflation.

#### Cost Shocks and Price Pass-through (with [Tim Richards](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XOAzQkEAAAAJ&hl=en))
###### We study the pass-through rate of state-level minimum wage changes to retail prices using reduced-form and structural methods. We develop a framework to analyze the importance of demand curvature and retail competition in explaining the cost-price pass-through during high and low inflation regimes.

#### Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets
###### I study sources and consequences of imperfect competitition in the US food retail and agricultural labor markets using approaches from IO and labor economics literature. In one project, I am using (1) recently developed heterogeneity-robust DiD and event-study estimators to understand effects of retail mergers and acquitions on labor market outcomes in the US food retail industry, and (2) production function estimation approach to estimate and characterize the labor markdowns. In another project, I am using a search, match, and bargaining model in Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides tradition to quantify markdowns in the US agriculture.
