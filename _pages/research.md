#### Cross-Platform Merger Effects, [Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uqzjcrk5b3hmvkxadktew/Cross_Platforms_Merger_Effects_UP.pdf?rlkey=4wcsohtefba49x4j1scqjnnio&dl=0)
###### I study the price effects of a merger between online retailer and a physical grocery chain in the US. Using a double robust causal inference method, I find price levels fall in the 8 of the 10 merger-affected markets.

#### Retail Concentration and Wages (with [Tim Richards](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XOAzQkEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Keenan Marchesi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l-VQifIAAAAJ&hl=en)), [Working Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815715), Submitted
###### Antitrust policy in the U.S. now explicitly includes labor-market outcomes as measures of interest when considering the potential anticompetitive effects of mergers or acquisitions. Concentration in the food retailing industry is of particular concern due to several recent high-profile mergers, and a troubling increase in concentration at the national and local levels. We study this problem using both causal reduced-form models and a structural model of search, match, and bargaining. Our reduced-form models show no relationship between concentration and wages, but our structural model finds that concentration is associated with substantial wage suppression.

#### Cost Shocks and Price Pass-through (with [Tim Richards](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XOAzQkEAAAAJ&hl=en))
###### We study the pass-through rate of state-level minimum wage changes to retail prices using reduced-form and structural methods. We develop a framework to analyze the importance of demand curvature and retail competition in explaining the cost-price pass-through during high and low inflation regimes.

#### Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets
###### I study sources and consequences of imperfect competitition in the US food retail and agricultural labor markets using approaches from IO and labor economics literature. In one project, I am using (1) recently developed heterogeneity-robust DiD and event-study estimators to understand effects of retail mergers and acquitions on labor market outcomes in the US food retail industry, and (2) production function estimation approach to estimate and characterize the labor markdowns. In another project, I am using a search, match, and bargaining model in Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides tradition to quantify markdowns in the US agriculture.
